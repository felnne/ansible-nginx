# Tests the Nginx web-server is correctly installed and configured by this role

# Management and configuration checks
# These checks mirror individual tasks to ensure they execute correctly
# (I.e. that they create a user in the right package or create the correct config file)

# Core configuration

- include: install.yml

- include: configure.yml

- include: configure-firewall.yml

- include: register-role.yml

# Server block tests
# As these tests only apply to certain scenarios (i.e. those with server blocks), tests for server blocks are loaded
# when needed from the 'site-test.yml' and 'site-ci.yml' playbooks.
#
# For reference server block test tasks are located in:
# * http.yml          - for testing http server blocks
# * https.yml         - for testing https server blocks
# * http-to-https.yml - fr testing http blocks which redirect to https blocks

# Registration checks
# This check ensures the Ansible local facts set by this role when it has been applied exist and use the correct value

- action: setup

- name: assert role was applied via BARC manifest
  assert:
    that:
      - "ansible_local.barc_nginx.general.role_applied == 'true'"

# Functionality checks
# These checks need to run after the package or service has been configured to ensure it is working correctly,
# using an configuration that may have been set by this role.

# In this role functionality checks are verified by an external VM (to check if connections are correctly blocked).
# To do this a special testing VM will run the 'functional-tests.yml' task file located alongside this file.
